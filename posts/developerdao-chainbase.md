PrimoSQL enables blockchain data analysts to own their SQL queries by storing them as NFTs, which can then be bought and sold with other analysts in the marketplace. The current problem in the blockchain analytics space is the platforms own the SQL queries analysts create and most queries are public by default. Chainbase is a natural fit to be the data provider for PrimoSQL because it keeps queries private by deafult.
